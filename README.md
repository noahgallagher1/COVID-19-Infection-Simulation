# COVID-19-Infection-Simulation
Used Python to simulate the probability of infection from Corona Virus based on interaction trajectories.
         
         1) Creates a simulation with an initial probability of infection. Pass through the number of people and the number of interactions to the                   simulation method.
         2) From this, the program will run a simulation and produce plot containing results about how much the disease spread among the population.
